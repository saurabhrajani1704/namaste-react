This is the Assignment 3 of the Namaste React Course By Akshay Saini 

Note: All the solutions are written by me. SO if you find any discrepancy or any mistake do google it as well to get correct and desired results. 

Question 1 : What is JSX ? 
Answer : JSX is javascript syntax. This syntax primarily used to write React in javascript. This syntax is easier to use as in core react the code gets clumsy so in 
order to get a clean code we use JSX. 
Note: JSX and HTML are NOT SAME. JSX is not HTML inside javascript but JSX is simply a JS object that has a syntax similar to HTML. 

Question 2 : What are some superpowers of JSX ? 
Answer : JSX is a syntax that is similar to HTML but is a JS object. Some of the important superpowers of JSX are as follows: 
        1: The syntax is developer friendly and clean as compared to core React 
        2: The syntax is similar to HTML so it is easier to write 
        3. We can easily create div containers and other nested elements in it without much issue. 

Question 3. What is the role of type attributes in script tag? What options can I use there ? 
Answer : The type attribute in the script tag is used primarily to specify what kind of script we are using in the script element. We can use mainly 4 values in it : 
        1: no value or empty string : This indicates that we are using classic Javascript Code in the script tag. 
        2: importmap: This value indiactes that we use a JSON object in the script tag that is used to control the modules in script tag 
        3: module : This value causes the code to be treated as a JavaScript module. The processing of the script contents is deferred. 

Question 4: {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX ? 

Answer : {TitleComponent} : This tag allows us to use this TitleComponent a React Element as a JavaScript  object i.e this React element is a JS function and thus 
            we can use JS in our React Code. 
         {<TitleComponent/>} : This tag allows us to use this TitleComponent a React Functional Component as a JavaScript  object i.e this React element is a JS function and thus 
            we can use JS in our React Code. 
        {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}:  This tag allows us to use this TitleComponent a React Functional Component as a JavaScript  object i.e this React element is a JS function and thus 
            we can use JS in our React Code.
